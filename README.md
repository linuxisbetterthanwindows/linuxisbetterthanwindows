- 👋 Hi, I’m @linuxisbetterthanwindows
- 👀 I’m interested in sitting on here so that I can connect it to a Discord account (though obviously I do have mediocre Python skills, haha).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, how to minimize energy used when commuting to the fridge, how to make minute rice in 59 seconds
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing as of now.... too lazy (oof).
- 📫 How to reach me: don't ask, I'm paranoid |:(
